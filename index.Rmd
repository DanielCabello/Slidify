# Objective:

Represent visually anomalies of temperature and precipitation at Navacerrada (Guadarrama mountain, Spain)

# Methodology:

1. Climatic data were collected from Navacerrada weather station for the period between 1947 and 2010.(source:AEMET)

2. Temperature and precipitation anomalies were calculated from the average of the reference value or long-term average.Difference between monthly or yearly values and its average at the base period 1946-1976.

3. Annual and monthly anomalies are plotted

# Annual Anomalies between 1947 and 2010
